# 30DaysOfJavaScript

The project is to build an HTML split testing service. A small portion of a web page will be replaced by various versions and metrics will be recorded for each version. The best performing version will most often be displayed. 

The whole project will be written in JavaScript. 

## Restraints:
* Vanilla JavaScript. No libraries. 
* Works on all active browsers. 
* Default works, even if script errors.
* Metrics are generic. 
* Limits can be set for any metric.
